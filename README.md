# Spam and Egg Musubi

Consisting of teriyaki-cooked spam, scrambled eggs and seasoned rice wrapped together with a strip of nori, this snack food originating from Hawaii has a surprising amount of flavor packed inside of its simple and affordable ingredients. While spam doesn't sound like the most exciting meat to eat, its softer texture pairs well with the egg and rice. 

There are a few steps to go through to complete this recipe, but overall it should take no longer than half an hour to complete, and with two musubi a serving, this can comfortably serve up to four people.

## How To Make
---

### 1. **Cook the rice**:
First, you need to wash your rice. This will remove If you have a lot of the excess starch on the surface of the rice, letting it stick together easier without getting all gummy after cooking. Place about two cups of rice in a wire-mesh strainer and continue to wash until the water coming from it is clear, roughly after five or six washes.

Next, you'll need to actually cook the rice. If you have a rice cooker, this step is easy. Take about two cups of your short grain rice and three cups of water (or whatever ratio your package instructions provide!) put it all into your rice cooker, press the button for white rice and let it cook.

If you don't have a rice cooker, you'll have to place the rice and water in a pot and then bring it to a boil on a stovetop. Make sure to stir once it boils to keep any rice from sticking and burning to the pot. After stirring, turn your heat down to low, cover the pot and leave it alone for about 15 to 20 minutes.

While your rice is cooking, you can work on the next few steps.

### 2. **Prepare the eggs:**
Take about five or six eggs and crack them into a bowl. Add salt and pepper and just a bit of water, and then begin whisking the eggs together until combined. After this, put some butter in your pan, turn it up to medium high, and once hot, pour out enough egg to cover the bottom surface of the pan and let them cook **undisturbed.**

As the eggs cook and settle, you can begin carefully moving some of the cooked edges towards the center to allow the raw egg in the middle to make its way out and cook as well. Eventually, once the egg doesn't have any visible runniness remaining, you can remove it from the pan and set the batch aside. 

If you have to do this in a couple of batches to avoid the eggs coming out too thick, that's okay. Don't cook them all together at the same time if your pan is too small.

Once all your batches of egg are cooked, you can set them aside and move on to the next step.

### 3. **Cook the spam**:
Before putting your spam on the pan, you'll want to prepare your teriyaki sauce to cook it in. Combine your soy sauce, rice vinegar, brown sugar, honey, ginger powder, sesame oil, garlic powder and sriracha (if you'd prefer some spice) into a bowl to taste. *There's no exact measurements here*, so just do it to your own preference and feeling. When you feel happy with the result, set it to the side for later.

Take out your spam and begin cutting it into 8-10 equal slices, ideally about half an inch or so thick. Once sliced, turn the heat on medium-high and place your slices into the pan, allowing them to cook with the remaining butter from the eggs you cooked before. If you need to, you can add some neutral oil to make sure everything cooks nicely, but it's generally not needed.

Continue pan frying the spam until one of the sides is golden and crispy. At this point, you can flip them over, turn the head down to medium-low and pour the sauce you prepared earlier into the pan. Let this sauce lightly simmer and take care that it **does not burn.** Eventually, it should reduce to a thicker glaze, at which point the spam can be removed and set aside to cool before plating.

### 4. **Finishing and Combining**:
With your spam, egg and rice now all ready, you can begin preparing them all for plating. First, if your rice has finished cooking, make sure to season it with salt, sugar and a little bit of rice vinegar before fluffing it with a fork.

After this, take the can that the spam came from and clean it out. Once clean, begin pressing the opening of it into your egg omelette to cut out spam-can sized cuts of egg. Do this until you have no more egg remaining.

Now, you can begin shaping the Musubi. Wet your hands before grabbing about a handful of rice, shaping it into a cylindrical shape about the same size as the egg and spam slices. The short grain rice should stick together without too much issue, and as long as you keep your hands wet, it should avoid sticking to your fingers. Once your rice is shaped, sprinkle some furikake on top, and if you'd like, put a dollop of sriracha in the middle. Then, put a slice of egg and a slice of spam on top. From here, all you have to do is cut out a 1-inch thick slice of nori and wrap it around the shape, and you'll have completed your spam musubi. Repeat this shaping process for all remaining rice, egg and spam.
